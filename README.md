## DOWNLOADING DATA 
In the Scripts folder, 01-download_data.R is the script to download the dataset using the opendatatoronto R package. The csv file that stores the data was unable to be added to this github repository as it was too big. If you want to download the data from your browser:
1. Go to https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/.
2. Scroll down to 'Download Data'
3. Download the dataset as a CSV file.

## RECREATING FIGURES
The dataset used can be found in the Data folder named COVID19_cases.csv. The script to create the dotplot and the summary statistics is found in the Scripts folder under the file name 02-data_analysis.R.

## USE OF LLM's 
Github Copilot was used when creating the R scripts for creating the figures in the report. It was used to help with writing functions and auto-completing lines of code.
